This folder's contents are responsible for creating a movie from the 
simulation, showing off the points as they move

1. Generate data. The data is generated by the simulation in another 
folder, but the data is automatically placed in tis directory.

in the main.cpp file in '..mpi/src/', set the bounds, number of points, 
and iteration count to the desired values, in the settings at the top of 
the file. Then, make sure the variable 'writeOut' = 1.

Generate the data:

make -C ../mpi
mpirun ../mpi/project_mpi.out

Note that the same may be done in either cuda or serial. just make the files as per normal and the same output will be achieved.

2. Using the python notebook 'Generate_Images.ipynb' ( open in Jupyter, JupyterLab), set the 
settings at the top of the file to the same that the 'main.cpp' file has

Convert each iteration to an image:
Run all blocks in the notebook in order

3. Convert to a video: Ensure ffmpeg is installed

chmod +x ./generate_video.sh
./generate_video.sh
